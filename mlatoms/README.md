**OBJECTIVE**

- Make a universal training routine
- Write one script for each algorithm (train)
- Write one script to encapsule each algorithm in an appropriate

These codes will probably be subject to medium evolution depending on the
evolution of the open source libraries they depend on.

These codes should also include openly available autoML libraries in 
order to assess the proprietary algorithms with existing solutions.
